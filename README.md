# AustralianTourism-CaseStudy

Case study on increasing tourism in Australia using RStudio. 

Tourism Australia is the Australian Government agency responsible for attracting international visitors to Australia, both for leisure and business events. 
$60.8 billion is contributed to the national GDP from tourism, a 3.4% year on year growth, which was faster than the national economy. 

The data set included binary data based on responses of 1003 individuals. I assigned IDs to each individual in order to analyze trends in the types of activities, advertising channels, TV channels, and booking methods. The data for the activities spanned from 1991 to 1997, so I conducted a logistic regression analysis to examine the popularity and revenue generated from activities over time. Ideally, I would have liked to conduct more customer segmentation, but since I didnâ€™t have any demographic information, my segmentation analysis was extremely limited. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
1. Booking trips through a travel agent brings in the most revenue, but it is the least popular method of booking.
2. The advertising channels with both the highest relative revenues and popularity are the internet, TV, travel agent, and newspaper ad.
3. Relaxing, shopping, sightseeing, eating, and scenic walks are the most popular activities with the first three seeing an increase from 1991 to 1997. 

--> RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Increase tourism through company contracts, travel agents, and social media influencers.
   2. Increase revenue generated from tourism through a personalized activity recommendation app.

EXECUTIVE ASK: $3 million investment to implement and advertise a new tourism app for personalized recommendations. Estimated ROI of 366%
